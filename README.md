# Title
User Profiling Attack Using Windows Registry Data
# Abstract
The Windows registry stores a glut of information containing settings and data utilized by the Microsoft operating system (OS) and other applications. For example, information such as user credentials, installed programs, recently used applications and documents, accessed resources such as local, remote, and removable devices can all be found in this database. More revealingly, the registry also has time and date stamps that can help build a timeline of user activities. The Windows registry can be easily queried by either malicious or benign applications. This is possible through the Windows Application Program Interface (API) and other OS built-in utilities. In this paper, we develop and demonstrate a program able to collect and infer a user’s rich activities by accessing the Windows registry alone. This information, also referred to as the user’s digital footprint, can be used to devise an exploit or create a privacy threat. Our custom developed application will demonstrate how a user’s digital footprint can be acquired by a malicious application from a Windows registry, without alerting security software. In addition, this information can be exported to a set of comma delimited files, making it easy to import them into other analysis applications.
